# Code Instructions and Information

## Introduction
This code is designed for data exploration and preprocessing tasks using Python's popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Scikit-learn. It involves loading a dataset, exploring its structure, handling missing values, and performing data type conversions.

## Instructions for Running the Code
Follow these steps to run the code successfully:

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries
Ensure that you have the following Python libraries installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- plotly

You can install these libraries using pip:


### Step 2: Download the Dataset
Download the dataset `WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv` from your source or repository and place it in the same directory as your Python script.

### Step 3: Run the Python Script
Execute the Python script containing the provided code. Ensure that the script file and the dataset file are in the same directory.

### Step 4: Review Output
The code will perform various data exploration and preprocessing tasks, including:

1. Loading the dataset.
2. Displaying information about the dataset's structure.
3. Exploring object and integer data types separately.
4. Checking for missing values.
5. Removing specific columns from the dataset.

Review the output in the console to observe the results of each step.

## Additional Information
- The code suppresses warnings to enhance readability.
- It detects and removes duplicate rows from the dataset.
- Four columns (`Over18`, `EmployeeNumber`, `EmployeeCount`, `StandardHours`) are dropped as they may not contribute significantly to the analysis.
